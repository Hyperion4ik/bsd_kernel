This is the fork of the FreeBSD source directory aimed to be a firewall.
The buildkernel and installkernel targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below). Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags. The kernel configuration
files reside in the sys/<arch>/conf sub-directory. FIREWALL is the default
configuration used in this fork builds.

Description of TCP State Machine

In the case of TCP, the finite state machine can be considered to describe the “life stages” of a connection. Each connection between one TCP device and another begins in a null state where there is no connection, and then proceeds through a series of states until a connection is established. It remains in that state until something occurs to cause the connection to be closed again, at which point it proceeds through another sequence of transitional states and returns to the closed state.
