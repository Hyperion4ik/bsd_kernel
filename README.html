<p>This is the fork of the FreeBSD source directory aimed to be a firewall.<br />
The <code>buildkernel</code> and <code>installkernel</code> targets build and install the kernel and the modules (see below). Please see the top of the Makefile in this directory for more information on the standard build targets and compile-time flags. The kernel configuration files reside in the sys/<arch>/conf sub-directory. FIREWALL is the default configuration used in this fork builds.</p>

<p>Description of TCP State Machine</p>
<p>In the case of TCP, the finite state machine can be considered to describe the “life stages” of a connection. Each connection between one TCP device and another begins in a null state where there is no connection, and then proceeds through a series of states until a connection is established. It remains in that state until something occurs to cause the connection to be closed again, at which point it proceeds through another sequence of transitional states and returns to the closed state.</p>
